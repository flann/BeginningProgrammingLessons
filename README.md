Some beginning lessons on javascript and HTML.

## Setup ##

If you install node.js, you can get a simple http server by installing the http-server npm module.

npm install http-server -g

The "startServer.bat" file will start the server in the correct directory to serve the files in the "public" folder.

Once the server is running, just browse to http://127.0.0.1:8080 or http://localhost:8080 (the port might also be 8081 if you've already got something running on port 8080).
