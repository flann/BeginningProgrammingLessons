Step 2: Rename the grids files for my page
Step 3: Decide what you want to do with this page
Step 4: Take out the myGrid div and change the text used as the title header
Step 5: change the script file name on top to whatever file name(folder name) you decide to use
Step 6: change the loadCss file name at the bottom to whatever file name(folder name) you decide to use
Step 7: go to the index.html page and add an exercise link just like the other pages(can even copy one page and change)
        Remember to change both the file name and the label (button) used to load the page
